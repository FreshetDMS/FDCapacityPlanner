Capacity Planner for Distributed Log Stores
===========================================

This repository contains a vector bin packing based capacity planning tool for distributed log stores.

The tool is based on code from [Variable-Size-Vector-Bin-Packing](https://github.com/mgabay/Variable-Size-Vector-Bin-Packing). Details on algorithms and heuristics used in this tool can be found in paper '[Variable size vector bin packing heuristics - Application to the machine reassignment problem](http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00868016)'.
